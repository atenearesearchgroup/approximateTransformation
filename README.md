# Overview

The increase in the amount of information produced by existing data sources requires the efficient processing of data flows in real time. Due to the large volume of data, applications that need to process this information to make informed decisions and to detect situations of interest usually impose strong requirements on resources.  

This repository provides the implementation and the results of all the experiments for the case study described in our paper entitled "Trading Accuracy for Performance in Data Processing Applications" [1], which proposes approximate solutions to process large amounts of information flows in order to reduce the amount of data to be processed and estimate the accuracy of this solutions based on the type of queries and the distribution of data. The accuracy is defined in terms of the precision and recall of the results obtained.
